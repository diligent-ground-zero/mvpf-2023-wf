## Deployment ðŸš€

The scripts and styles are intended to be deployed via CDN.
We used JSdelivr's (https://www.jsdelivr.com/) free CDN Github mirroring to host and serve the projects files in `/dist`.



1. `yarn build`, push changes to Github and create a version Tag
2. Create a new Release in Github
3. Go to https://www.jsdelivr.com/github and convert the Tagged repo version following this structure: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file`
4. Insert the generated scripts CDN URL's into Webflow (either in the global HEAD or site specific HEAD)
